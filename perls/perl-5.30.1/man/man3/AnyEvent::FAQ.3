.SS "My program exits before doing anything, what's going on?"
.IX Subsection "My program exits before doing anything, what's going on?"
Programmers new to event-based programming often forget that you can
actually do other stuff while \*(L"waiting\*(R" for an event to occur and
therefore forget to actually wait when they do not, in fact, have anything
else to do.
.PP
Here is an example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   use AnyEvent;
\&
\&   my $timer = AnyEvent\->timer (after => 5, cb => sub { say "hi" });
.Ve
.PP
The expectation might be for the program to print \*(L"hi\*(R" after 5 seconds
and then probably to exit. However, if you run this, your program will
exit almost instantly: Creating the timer does not wait for it, instead
the \f(CW\*(C`timer\*(C'\fR method returns immediately and perl executes the rest of the
program. But there is nothing left to execute, so perl exits.
.PP
To force AnyEvent to wait for something, use a condvar:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   use AnyEvent;
\&
\&   my $quit_program = AnyEvent\->condvar;
\&   my $timer = AnyEvent\->timer (after => 5, cb => sub { $quit_program\->send });
\&
\&   $quit_program\->recv;
.Ve
.PP
Here the program doesn't immediately exit, because it first waits for
the \*(L"quit_program\*(R" condition.
.PP
In most cases, your main program should call the event library \*(L"loop\*(R"
function directly:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   use EV;
\&   use AnyEvent;
\&
\&   ...
\&
\&   EV::loop;
.Ve
.ie n .SS "Why is my ""tcp_connect"" callback never called?"
.el .SS "Why is my \f(CWtcp_connect\fP callback never called?"
.IX Subsection "Why is my tcp_connect callback never called?"
Tricky: \f(CW\*(C`tcp_connect\*(C'\fR (and a few other functions in AnyEvent::Socket)
is critically sensitive to the caller context.
.PP
In void context, it will just do its thing and eventually call the
callback. In any other context, however, it will return a special \*(L"guard\*(R"
object \- when it is destroyed (e.g. when you don't store it but throw it
away), tcp_connect will no longer try to connect or call any callbacks.
.PP
Often this happens when the \f(CW\*(C`tcp_connect\*(C'\fR call is at the end of a function:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&   sub do_connect {
\&      tcp_connect "www.example.com", 80, sub {
\&         ... lengthy code
\&      };
\&   }
.Ve
.PP
Then the caller decides whether there is a void context or not. One can
avoid these cases by explicitly returning nothing:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&   sub do_connect {
\&      tcp_connect "www.example.com", 80, sub {
\&         ... lengthy code
\&      };
\&
\&      () # return nothing
\&   }
.Ve
.ie n .SS "Why do some backends use a lot of \s-1CPU\s0 in ""AE::cv\->recv""?"
.el .SS "Why do some backends use a lot of \s-1CPU\s0 in \f(CWAE::cv\->recv\fP?"
.IX Subsection "Why do some backends use a lot of CPU in AE::cv->recv?"
Many people try out this simple program, or its equivalent:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   use AnyEvent;
\&   AnyEvent\->condvar\->recv;
.Ve
.PP
They are then shocked to see that this basically idles with the Perl
backend, but uses 100% \s-1CPU\s0 with the \s-1EV\s0 backend, which is supposed to be
sooo efficient.
.PP
The key to understand this is to understand that the above program
is actually \fIbuggy\fR: Nothing calls \f(CW\*(C`\->send\*(C'\fR on the condvar,
ever. Worse, there are no event watchers whatsoever. Basically, it creates
a deadlock: there is no way to make progress, this program doesn't do
anything useful, and this will not change in the future: it is already an
ex-parrot.
.PP
Some backends react to this by freezing, some by idling, and some do a
100% \s-1CPU\s0 loop.
.PP
Since this program is not useful (and behaves as documented with all
backends, as AnyEvent makes no \s-1CPU\s0 time guarantees), this shouldn't be a
big deal: as soon as your program actually implements \fIsomething\fR, the
\&\s-1CPU\s0 usage will be normal.
.SS "Why does this \s-1FAQ\s0 not deal with AnyEvent::Handle questions?"
.IX Subsection "Why does this FAQ not deal with AnyEvent::Handle questions?"
Because AnyEvent::Handle has a \s-1NONFAQ\s0 on its own that already deals
with common issues.
.SS "How can I combine Win32::GUI applications with AnyEvent?"
.IX Subsection "How can I combine Win32::GUI applications with AnyEvent?"
Well, not in the same \s-1OS\s0 thread, that's for sure :) What you can do is
create another ithread (or fork) and run AnyEvent inside that thread, or
better yet, run all your \s-1GUI\s0 code in a second ithread.
.PP
For example, you could load Win32::GUI and AnyEvent::Util, then
create a portable socketpair for \s-1GUI\-\s0>AnyEvent communication.
.PP
Then fork/create a new ithread, in there, create a Window and send the \f(CW\*(C`$WINDOW\->{\-Handle}\*(C'\fR to the AnyEvent ithread so it can \f(CW\*(C`PostMessage\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\s-1GUI\s0 to AnyEvent communication could work by pushing some data into a
Thread::Queue and writing a byte into the socket. The AnyEvent watcher
on the other side will then look at the queue.
.PP
AnyEvent to \s-1GUI\s0 communications can also use a Thread::Queue, but to
wake up the \s-1GUI\s0 thread, it would instead use \f(CW\*(C`Win32::GUI::PostMessage
$WINDOW, 1030, 0, ""\*(C'\fR, and the \s-1GUI\s0 thread would listen for these
messages by using \f(CW\*(C`$WINDOW\->Hook (1030 (), sub { ... })\*(C'\fR.
.SS "My callback dies and..."
.IX Subsection "My callback dies and..."
It must not \- part of the contract betwene AnyEvent and user code is that
callbacks do not throw exceptions (and don't do even more evil things,
such as using \f(CW\*(C`last\*(C'\fR outside a loop :). If your callback might die
sometimes, you need to use \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR.
.PP
If you want to track down such a case and you can reproduce it, you can
enable wrapping (by calling \f(CW\*(C`AnyEvent::Debug::wrap\*(C'\fR or by setting
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL_ANYEVENT_DEBUG_WRAP=1\*(C'\fR before starting your program). This will
wrap every callback into an eval and will report any exception complete
with a backtrace and some information about which watcher died, where it
was created and so on.
