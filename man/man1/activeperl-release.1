.SH "ActivePerl 2601 \*(-- Release Notes"
.IX Header "ActivePerl 2601 Release Notes"
Welcome, and thank you for downloading ActivePerl.  This release
corresponds to Perl version 5.26.1.
.PP
The following platforms are supported by this release:
.IP "\(bu" 3
Linux: glibc 2.15 or later (x64), e.g. Ubuntu 12.04 or later
.IP "\(bu" 3
Mac \s-1OS X 10.9\s0 or later (x64)
.IP "\(bu" 3
Windows Server 2008, 7, Server 2012, 8 (x86 and x64), and 10.
.SH "Incompatibilities"
.IX Header "Incompatibilities"
Perl 5.26 is not binary compatible with Perl 5.24 and earlier releases.  In particular, do not
attempt to use extensions or \s-1PPM\s0 packages built for ActivePerl 2400 and older
series builds with ActivePerl 2600 series builds and vice versa.  Please
check \*(L"Incompatible Changes\*(R" in perl5260delta for known source level
incompatibilities between the Perl 5.26 releases and the earlier release
series.
.SH "Known Issues"
.IX Header "Known Issues"
.SS "\s-1PPM\s0"
.IX Subsection "PPM"
There are some known outstanding issues with the \s-1PPM 4\s0 client:
.IP "\(bu" 3
The \s-1PPM\s0 state database (containing configuration information for
repositories, view options in the \s-1GUI,\s0 and repository state) is not
imported from previous installations.
.Sp
If you have added custom \s-1PPM 4\s0 repositories in previous ActivePerl releases
then you should reconfigure them manually with \f(CW\*(C`ppm repo add ...\*(C'\fR or in the
\&\s-1GUI.\s0  The repository state will be automatically re-synchronized when
\&\s-1PPM\s0 is run.
.IP "\(bu" 3
Post install scripts for packages installed from the \s-1GUI\s0 will not be able to
receive non-default answers for any prompts it might produce.  Packages that
need non-default answers must be installed with the command line version
of ppm.
.IP "\(bu" 3
List icons will sometimes not repaint properly after scrolling under
X11.  This does not affect the Windows and Mac \s-1OS X\s0 builds.
.SS "Mac \s-1OS X\s0"
.IX Subsection "Mac OS X"
.IP "\(bu" 3
Perl library paths, and thus \s-1PPM\s0 Areas, defined in the shell by the
\&\s-1PERL5LIB\s0 environment variable are not available to \s-1PPM\s0 when it is
launched by clicking the \s-1PPM\s0 icon in \s-1OS X.\s0 To to make this variable
available in the \s-1OS X GUI,\s0 add an entry similar to the following to
\&\fI~/.MacOSX/environment.plist\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& <key>PERL5LIB</key>
\& <string>/path/to/perl/lib</string>
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 3
Running \f(CW\*(C`sudo ppm\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`sudo ppm gui\*(C'\fR does not start up the \s-1GUI\s0 with
\&\fIroot\fR privileges.  Use \f(CW\*(C`ppm\*(C'\fR as a command line tool with \f(CW\*(C`sudo\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Windows"
.IX Subsection "Windows"
.IP "\(bu" 3
The \fBfork()\fR emulation has known limitations.  See perlfork for a
detailed summary.  In particular, \fBfork()\fR emulation will not work
correctly with extensions that are either not thread-safe, or maintain
internal state that cannot be cloned in the pseudo-child process.  This
caveat currently applies to extensions such as Tk and Storable.
.IP "\(bu" 3
It is possible to install different major versions at the
same time as long as you are careful to use different directories. Do not install
a newer major version of ActivePerl on top of an older version. It is best to uninstall
any older versions and then install this one.
.IP "\(bu" 3
5.26.x minor version updates can be installed seamlessly on top of an existing 5.26.0 (or later) version.
The installer will first remove files from the old version and then install the new version.
If you changed the default installation directory, you will need to select a custom install and
then choose the directory containing the previous 5.26.x version.
.IP "\(bu" 3
When upgrading, it can be helpful to save the list of installed \s-1PPM\s0 modules so they
can be quickly reinstalled for 5.26. From a command-line, run:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& C:\e> ppm profile save my\-modules.xml
.Ve
.Sp
After installing the newer version, use the my\-modules.xml file to reinstall the
modules:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& C:\e> ppm profile restore my\-modules.xml
.Ve
.Sp
For future minor versions (5.26.1, etc.), the installer will be able
to upgrade the current version without requiring an uninstall.
.Sp
If you have any problems with the new installer, you can install from the zip file
version. Remember to run the Installer.bat file included with the zip.
.SS "Further Information"
.IX Subsection "Further Information"
The Perl distribution comes with extensive documentation.  On Unix platforms,
all the standard documentation is installed as man pages under the Perl
install location.  The location of the man pages may need to be added to the
\&\s-1MANPATH\s0 environment variable in order to access them.  For example, in
the C shell:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    % setenv MANPATH /opt/ActivePerl\-5.26/man:$MANPATH
.Ve
.PP
The documentation is installed in \s-1HTML\s0 format on all platforms. If ActivePerl
was installed in \fI/opt/ActivePerl\-5.26\fR then the \s-1HTML\s0 documentation
would be located in \fI/opt/ActivePerl\-5.26/html\fR.
.PP
On Windows, the standard documentation along with Windows-specific Perl
documentation is installed in \s-1HTML\s0 format, and is accessible from the
\&\*(L"Start\*(R" menu.
.PP
Updated versions of the \s-1HTML\s0 documentation will always be available at
the ActiveState website:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl
.Ve
.SH "Reporting Problems"
.IX Header "Reporting Problems"
Please report any bugs you encounter with this release in the ActiveState bug
database:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    http://bugs.activestate.com
.Ve
.PP
If you do not have web access, reports can be also sent via email to
ActivePerl\-Bugs@ActiveState.com.  Please be sure to include detailed
information about the platform in your message.
.PP
As far as possible, please ensure that there is enough information in
the report to reproduce the bug elsewhere.  It also helps to submit a
minimal test case that exhibits the bug.
.SH "ActivePerl Community Edition Support Policy"
.IX Header "ActivePerl Community Edition Support Policy"
The two most recent stable releases are available for free
download. This corresponds to the Perl community's own version support
policy.
.PP
Whenever the underlying Perl version becomes \*(L"unsupported\*(R" by the Perl
community itself, support for the corresponding ActivePerl versions
will be limited to Business Edition and Enterprise Edition customers.
.PP
You can continue to use older ActivePerl releases indefinitely under
the terms of the Community Edition license, but won't be able to
download the installers from ActiveState.
.PP
The \s-1PPM\s0 repositories for unsupported ActivePerl releases will remain
freely accessible for at least 6 months after support ends, but will
no longer be updated with new builds from \s-1CPAN.\s0
