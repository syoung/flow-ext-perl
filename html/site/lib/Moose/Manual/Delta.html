<p>Moose::Manual::Delta - Important Changes in Moose</p>

<h1 id="VERSION">VERSION</h1>

<p>version 2.2012</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>This documents any important or noteworthy changes in Moose, with a focus on things that affect backwards compatibility. This does duplicate data from the <i>Changes</i> file, but aims to provide more details and when possible workarounds.</p>

<p>Besides helping keep up with changes, you can also use this document for finding the lowest version of Moose that supported a given feature. If you encounter a problem and have a solution but don&#39;t see it documented here, or think we missed an important feature, please send us a patch.</p>

<h1 id="pod2.1400">2.1400</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="Overloading-implementation-has-changed">Overloading implementation has changed</dt>
<dd>

<p>Overloading meta information used to be implemented by a <code>Class::MOP::Method::Overload</code> class. This class has been removed, and overloading is now implemented by <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/Class/MOP/Overload.html">Class::MOP::Overload</a>. Overloading is not really equivalent to a method, so the former implementation didn&#39;t work properly for various cases.</p>

<p>All of the overloading-related methods for classes and roles have the same names, but those methods now return <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/Class/MOP/Overload.html">Class::MOP::Overload</a> objects.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Core-support-for-overloading-in-roles">Core support for overloading in roles</dt>
<dd>

<p>Roles which use overloading now pass that overloading onto other classes (and roles) which consume that role.</p>

<p>This works much like <a>MooseX::Role::WithOverloading</a>, except that we properly detect overloading conflicts during role summation and when applying one role to another. <a>MooseX::Role::WithOverloading</a> did not do any conflict detection.</p>

<p>If you want to write code that uses overloading and works with previous versions of Moose and this one, upgrade to <a>MooseX::Role::WithOverloading</a> version 0.15 or greater. That version will detect when Moose itself handles overloading and get out of the way.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="pod2.1200">2.1200</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="Classes-created-by-Moose-are-now-registered-in-INC">Classes created by Moose are now registered in <code>%INC</code></dt>
<dd>

<p>This means that this will no longer die (and will also no longer try to load <code>Foo.pm</code>):</p>

<pre><code>  {
      package Foo;
      use Moose;
  }

  # ...

  use Foo;</code></pre>

<p>If you&#39;re using the MOP, this behavior will occur when the <code>create</code> (or <code>create_anon_class</code>) method is used, but not when the <code>initialize</code> method is used.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Moose-now-uses-Module::Runtime-instead-of-Class::Load-to-load-classes">Moose now uses <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/Module/Runtime.html">Module::Runtime</a> instead of <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/Class/Load.html">Class::Load</a> to load classes</dt>
<dd>

<p>Class::Load has always had some weird issues with the ways that it tries to figure out if a class is loaded. For instance, extending an empty package was previously impossible, because Class::Load would think that the class failed to load, even though that is a perfectly valid thing to do. It was also difficult to deal with modules like <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/IO/Handle.html">IO::Handle</a>, which partially populate several other packages when they are loaded (so calling <code>load_class</code> on <code>&#39;IO::Handle&#39;</code> followed by <code>&#39;IO::File&#39;</code> could end up with a broken <code>IO::File</code>, in some cases).</p>

<p>Now, Moose uses the same mechanisms as perl itself to figure out if a class is loaded. A class is considered to be loaded if its entry in <code>%INC</code> is set. Perl sets the <code>%INC</code> entry for you automatically whenever a file is loaded via <code>use</code> or <code>require</code>. Also, as mentioned above, Moose also now sets the <code>%INC</code> entry for any classes defined with it, even if they aren&#39;t loaded from a separate file. This does however mean that if you are trying to use Moose with non-Moose classes defined in the same file, then you will need to set <code>%INC</code> manually now, where it may have worked in the past. For instance:</p>

<pre><code>  {
      package My::NonMoose;

      sub new { bless {}, shift }

      $INC{&#39;My/NonMoose.pm&#39;} = __FILE__;
      # alternatively:
      # use Module::Runtime &#39;module_notional_filename&#39;;
      # $INC{module_notional_filename(__PACKAGE__)} = __FILE__;
  }

  {
      package My::Moose;
      use Moose;

      extends &#39;My::NonMoose&#39;;
  }</code></pre>

<p>If you don&#39;t do this, you will get an error message about not being able to locate <code>My::NonMoose</code> in <code>@INC</code>. We hope that this case will be fairly rare.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="The-Class::Load-wrapper-functions-in-Class::MOP-have-been-deprecated">The Class::Load wrapper functions in Class::MOP have been deprecated</dt>
<dd>

<p><code>Class::MOP::load_class</code>, <code>Class::MOP::is_class_loaded</code>, and <code>Class::MOP::load_first_existing_class</code> have been deprecated. They have been undocumented and discouraged since version 2.0200. You should replace their use with the corresponding functions in <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/Class/Load.html">Class::Load</a>, or just use <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/Module/Runtime.html">Module::Runtime</a> directly.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="The-non-arrayref-forms-of-enum-and-duck_type-have-been-deprecated">The non-arrayref forms of <code>enum</code> and <code>duck_type</code> have been deprecated</dt>
<dd>

<p>Originally, <code>enum</code> could be called like this:</p>

<pre><code>  enum(&#39;MyType&#39; =&gt; qw(foo bar baz))</code></pre>

<p>This was confusing, however (since it was different from the syntax for anonymous enum types), and it makes error checking more difficult (since you can&#39;t tell just by looking whether <code>enum(&#39;Foo&#39;, &#39;Bar&#39;, &#39;Baz&#39;)</code> was intended to be a type named <code>Foo</code> with elements of <code>Bar</code> and <code>Baz</code>, or if this was actually a mistake where someone got the syntax for an anonymous enum type wrong). This all also applies to <code>duck_type</code>.</p>

<p>Calling <code>enum</code> and <code>duck_type</code> with a list of arguments as described above has been undocumented since version 0.93, and is now deprecated. You should replace</p>

<pre><code>  enum MyType =&gt; qw(foo bar baz);</code></pre>

<p>in your code with</p>

<pre><code>  enum MyType =&gt; [qw(foo bar baz)];</code></pre>

</dd>
<dt id="Moose-string-exceptions-have-been-replaced-by-Moose-exception-objects">Moose string exceptions have been replaced by Moose exception objects</dt>
<dd>

<p>Previously, Moose threw string exceptions on error conditions, which were not so verbose. All those string exceptions have now been converted to exception objects, which provide very detailed information about the exceptions. These exception objects provide a string overload that matches the previous exception message, so in most cases you should not have to change your code.</p>

<p>For learning about the usage of Moose exception objects, read <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/Moose/Manual/Exceptions.html">Moose::Manual::Exceptions</a>. Individual exceptions are documented in <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/Moose/Manual/Exceptions/Manifest.html">Moose::Manual::Exceptions::Manifest</a>.</p>

<h1 id="pod2.1000">2.1000</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="The-Num-type-is-now-stricter">The Num type is now stricter</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <code>Num</code> type used to accept anything that fits Perl&#39;s notion of a number, which included Inf, NaN, and strings like <code>&quot; 1234 \n&quot;</code>. We believe that the type constraint should indicate &quot;this is a number&quot;, not &quot;this coerces to a number&quot;. Therefore, Num now only accepts integers, floating point numbers (both in decimal notation and exponential notation), 0, .0, 0.0, etc.</p>

<p>If you want the old behavior you can use the <code>LaxNum</code> type in <a>MooseX::Types::LaxNum</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="You-can-use-Specio-instead-of-core-Moose-types">You can use <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/Specio.html">Specio</a> instead of core Moose types</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/Specio.html">Specio</a> distribution is an experimental new type system intended to eventually replace the core Moose types, but yet also work with things like <a>Moo</a> and <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/site_perl/5.26.3/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/Mouse.html">Mouse</a> and anything else. Right now this is all speculative, but at least you can use Specio with Moose.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="pod2.0600">2.0600</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="init_meta-is-even-less-reliable-at-loading-extensions"><code>-&gt;init_meta</code> is even less reliable at loading extensions</dt>
<dd>

<p>Previously, calling <code>MooseX::Foo-&gt;init_meta(@_)</code> (and nothing else) from within your own <code>init_meta</code> had a decent chance of doing something useful. This was never supported behavior, and didn&#39;t always work anyway. Due to some implementation adjustments, this now has a smaller chance of doing something useful, which could break code that was expecting it to continue doing useful things. Code that does this should instead just call <code>MooseX::Foo-&gt;import({ into =&gt; $into })</code>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="All-the-Cookbook-recipes-have-been-renamed">All the Cookbook recipes have been renamed</dt>
<dd>

<p>We&#39;ve given them all descriptive names, rather than numbers. This makes it easier to talk about them, and eliminates the need to renumber recipes in order to reorder them or delete one.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="pod2.0400">2.0400</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="The-parent-of-a-union-type-is-its-components-nearest-common-ancestor">The parent of a union type is its components&#39; nearest common ancestor</dt>
<dd>

<p>Previously, union types considered all of their component types their parent types. This was incorrect because parent types are defined as types that must be satisfied in order for the child type to be satisfied, but in a union, validating as any parent type will validate against the entire union. This has been changed to find the nearest common ancestor for all of its components. For example, a union of &quot;Int|ArrayRef[Int]&quot; now has a parent of &quot;Defined&quot;.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Union-types-consider-all-members-in-the-is_subtype_of-and-is_a_type_of-methods">Union types consider all members in the <code>is_subtype_of</code> and <code>is_a_type_of</code> methods</dt>
<dd>

<p>Previously, a union type would report itself as being of a subtype of a type if <i>any</i> of its member types were subtypes of that type. This was incorrect because any value that passes a subtype constraint must also pass a parent constraint. This has changed so that <i>all</i> of its member types must be a subtype of the specified type.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Enum-types-now-work-with-just-one-value">Enum types now work with just one value</dt>
<dd>

<p>Previously, an <code>enum</code> type needed to have two or more values. Nobody knew why, so we fixed it.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Methods-defined-in-UNIVERSAL-now-appear-in-the-MOP">Methods defined in UNIVERSAL now appear in the MOP</dt>
<dd>

<p>Any method introspection methods that look at methods from parent classes now find methods defined in UNIVERSAL. This includes methods like <code>$class-&gt;get_all_methods</code> and <code>$class-&gt;find_method_by_name</code>.</p>

<p>This also means that you can now apply method modifiers to these methods.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Hand-optimized-type-constraint-code-causes-a-deprecation-warning">Hand-optimized type constraint code causes a deprecation warning</dt>
<dd>

<p>If you provide an optimized sub ref for a type constraint, this now causes a deprecation warning. Typically, this comes from passing an <code>optimize_as</code> parameter to <code>subtype</code>, but it could also happen if you create a <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/Moose/Meta/TypeConstraint.html">Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint</a> object directly.</p>

<p>Use the inlining feature (<code>inline_as</code>) added in 2.0100 instead.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Class::Load::load_class-and-is_class_loaded-have-been-removed"><code>Class::Load::load_class</code> and <code>is_class_loaded</code> have been removed</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <code>Class::MOP::load_class</code> and <code>Class::MOP::is_class_loaded</code> subroutines are no longer documented, and will cause a deprecation warning in the future. Moose now uses <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/Class/Load.html">Class::Load</a> to provide this functionality, and you should do so as well.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="pod2.0205">2.0205</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="Array-and-Hash-native-traits-provide-a-shallow_clone-method">Array and Hash native traits provide a <code>shallow_clone</code> method</dt>
<dd>

<p>The Array and Hash native traits now provide a &quot;shallow_clone&quot; method, which will return a reference to a new container with the same contents as the attribute&#39;s reference.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="pod2.0200">2.0200</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="Hand-optimized-type-constraint-code-is-deprecated-in-favor-of-inlining">Hand-optimized type constraint code is deprecated in favor of inlining</dt>
<dd>

<p>Moose allows you to provide a hand-optimized version of a type constraint&#39;s subroutine reference. This version allows type constraints to generate inline code, and you should use this inlining instead of providing a hand-optimized subroutine reference.</p>

<p>This affects the <code>optimize_as</code> sub exported by <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/Moose/Util/TypeConstraints.html">Moose::Util::TypeConstraints</a>. Use <code>inline_as</code> instead.</p>

<p>This will start warning in the 2.0300 release.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="pod2.0002">2.0002</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="More-useful-type-constraint-error-messages">More useful type constraint error messages</dt>
<dd>

<p>If you have <a>Devel::PartialDump</a> version 0.14 or higher installed, Moose&#39;s type constraint error messages will use it to display the invalid value, rather than just displaying it directly. This will generally be much more useful. For instance, instead of this:</p>

<pre><code>  Attribute (foo) does not pass the type constraint because: Validation failed for &#39;ArrayRef[Int]&#39; with value ARRAY(0x275eed8)</code></pre>

<p>the error message will instead look like</p>

<pre><code>  Attribute (foo) does not pass the type constraint because: Validation failed for &#39;ArrayRef[Int]&#39; with value [ &quot;a&quot; ]</code></pre>

<p>Note that <a>Devel::PartialDump</a> can&#39;t be made a direct dependency at the moment, because it uses Moose itself, but we&#39;re considering options to make this easier.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="pod2.0000">2.0000</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="Roles-have-their-own-default-attribute-metaclass">Roles have their own default attribute metaclass</dt>
<dd>

<p>Previously, when a role was applied to a class, it would use the attribute metaclass defined in the class when copying over the attributes in the role. This was wrong, because for instance, using <a>MooseX::FollowPBP</a> in the class would end up renaming all of the accessors generated by the role, some of which may be being called in the role, causing it to break. Roles now keep track of their own attribute metaclass to use by default when being applied to a class (defaulting to Moose::Meta::Attribute). This is modifiable using <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/Moose/Util/MetaRole.html">Moose::Util::MetaRole</a> by passing the <code>applied_attribute</code> key to the <code>role_metaroles</code> option, as in:</p>

<pre><code>    Moose::Util::MetaRole::apply_metaroles(
        for =&gt; __PACKAGE__,
        class_metaroles =&gt; {
            attribute =&gt; [&#39;My::Meta::Role::Attribute&#39;],
        },
        role_metaroles =&gt; {
            applied_attribute =&gt; [&#39;My::Meta::Role::Attribute&#39;],
        },
    );</code></pre>

</dd>
<dt id="Class::MOP-has-been-folded-into-the-Moose-dist">Class::MOP has been folded into the Moose dist</dt>
<dd>

<p>Moose and Class::MOP are tightly related enough that they have always had to be kept pretty closely in step in terms of versions. Making them into a single dist should simplify the upgrade process for users, as it should no longer be possible to upgrade one without the other and potentially cause issues. No functionality has changed, and this should be entirely transparent.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Mooses-conflict-checking-is-more-robust-and-useful">Moose&#39;s conflict checking is more robust and useful</dt>
<dd>

<p>There are two parts to this. The most useful one right now is that Moose will ship with a <code>moose-outdated</code> script, which can be run at any point to list the modules which are installed that conflict with the installed version of Moose. After upgrading Moose, running <code>moose-outdated | cpanm</code> should be sufficient to ensure that all of the Moose extensions you use will continue to work.</p>

<p>The other part is that Moose&#39;s <code>META.json</code> file will also specify the conflicts under the <code>x_conflicts</code> (now <code>x_breaks</code>) key. We are working with the Perl tool chain developers to try to get conflicts support added to CPAN clients, and if/when that happens, the metadata already exists, and so the conflict checking will become automatic.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="The-lazy_build-attribute-feature-is-discouraged">The lazy_build attribute feature is discouraged</dt>
<dd>

<p>While not deprecated, we strongly discourage you from using this feature.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Most-deprecated-APIs-features-are-slated-for-removal-in-Moose-2.0200">Most deprecated APIs/features are slated for removal in Moose 2.0200</dt>
<dd>

<p>Most of the deprecated APIs and features in Moose will start throwing an error in Moose 2.0200. Some of the features will go away entirely, and some will simply throw an error.</p>

<p>The things on the chopping block are:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Old public methods in Class::MOP and Moose</p>

<p>This includes things like <code>Class::MOP::Class-&gt;get_attribute_map</code>, <code>Class::MOP::Class-&gt;construct_instance</code>, and many others. These were deprecated in <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/Class/MOP.html">Class::MOP</a> 0.80_01, released on April 5, 2009.</p>

<p>These methods will be removed entirely in Moose 2.0200.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Old public functions in Class::MOP</p>

<p>This include <code>Class::MOP::subname</code>, <code>Class::MOP::in_global_destruction</code>, and the <code>Class::MOP::HAS_ISAREV</code> constant. The first two were deprecated in 0.84, and the last in 0.80. Class::MOP 0.84 was released on May 12, 2009.</p>

<p>These functions will be removed entirely in Moose 2.0200.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The <code>alias</code> and <code>excludes</code> option for role composition</p>

<p>These were renamed to <code>-alias</code> and <code>-excludes</code> in Moose 0.89, released on August 13, 2009.</p>

<p>Passing these will throw an error in Moose 2.0200.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The old <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/Moose/Util/MetaRole.html">Moose::Util::MetaRole</a> API</p>

<p>This include the <code>apply_metaclass_roles()</code> function, as well as passing the <code>for_class</code> or any key ending in <code>_roles</code> to <code>apply_metaroles()</code>. This was deprecated in Moose 0.93_01, released on January 4, 2010.</p>

<p>These will all throw an error in Moose 2.0200.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Passing plain lists to <code>type()</code> or <code>subtype()</code></p>

<p>The old API for these functions allowed you to pass a plain list of parameter, rather than a list of hash references (which is what <code>as()</code>, <code>where</code>, etc. return). This was deprecated in Moose 0.71_01, released on February 22, 2009.</p>

<p>This will throw an error in Moose 2.0200.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The Role subtype</p>

<p>This subtype was deprecated in Moose 0.84, released on June 26, 2009.</p>

<p>This will be removed entirely in Moose 2.0200.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>As of the 2.0 release, Moose now has an official release and support policy, documented in <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/Moose/Manual/Support.html">Moose::Manual::Support</a>. All API changes will now go through a deprecation cycle of at least one year, after which the deprecated API can be removed. Deprecations and removals will only happen in major releases.</p>

<p>In between major releases, we will still make minor releases to add new features, fix bugs, update documentation, etc.</p>

<dt id="Configurable-stacktraces">Configurable stacktraces</dt>
<dd>

<p>Classes which use the <a>Moose::Error::Default</a> error class can now have stacktraces disabled by setting the <code>MOOSE_ERROR_STYLE</code> env var to <code>croak</code>. This is experimental, fairly incomplete, and won&#39;t work in all cases (because Moose&#39;s error system in general is all of these things), but this should allow for reducing at least some of the verbosity in most cases.</p>

<dt id="Native-Delegations">Native Delegations</dt>
<dd>

<p>In previous versions of Moose, the Native delegations were created as closures. The generated code was often quite slow compared to doing the same thing by hand. For example, the Array&#39;s push delegation ended up doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>  push @{ $self-&gt;$reader() }, @_;</code></pre>

<p>If the attribute was created without a reader, the <code>$reader</code> sub reference followed a very slow code path. Even with a reader, this is still slower than it needs to be.</p>

<p>Native delegations are now generated as inline code, just like other accessors, so we can access the slot directly.</p>

<p>In addition, native traits now do proper constraint checking in all cases. In particular, constraint checking has been improved for array and hash references. Previously, only the <i>contained</i> type (the <code>Str</code> in <code>HashRef[Str]</code>) would be checked when a new value was added to the collection. However, if there was a constraint that applied to the whole value, this was never checked.</p>

<p>In addition, coercions are now called on the whole value.</p>

<p>The delegation methods now do more argument checking. All of the methods check that a valid number of arguments were passed to the method. In addition, the delegation methods check that the arguments are sane (array indexes, hash keys, numbers, etc.) when applicable. We have tried to emulate the behavior of Perl builtins as much as possible.</p>

<p>Finally, triggers are called whenever the value of the attribute is changed by a Native delegation.</p>

<p>These changes are only likely to break code in a few cases.</p>

<p>The inlining code may or may not preserve the original reference when changes are made. In some cases, methods which change the value may replace it entirely. This will break tied values.</p>

<p>If you have a typed arrayref or hashref attribute where the type enforces a constraint on the whole collection, this constraint will now be checked. It&#39;s possible that code which previously ran without errors will now cause the constraint to fail. However, presumably this is a good thing ;)</p>

<p>If you are passing invalid arguments to a delegation which were previously being ignored, these calls will now fail.</p>

<p>If your code relied on the trigger only being called for a regular writer, that may cause problems.</p>

<p>As always, you are encouraged to test before deploying the latest version of Moose to production.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Defaults-is-and-default-for-String-Counter-and-Bool">Defaults is and default for String, Counter, and Bool</dt>
<dd>

<p>A few native traits (String, Counter, Bool) provide default values of &quot;is&quot; and &quot;default&quot; when you created an attribute. Allowing them to provide these values is now deprecated. Supply the value yourself when creating the attribute.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="The-meta-method">The <code>meta</code> method</dt>
<dd>

<p>Moose and Class::MOP have been cleaned up internally enough to make the <code>meta</code> method that you get by default optional. <code>use Moose</code> and <code>use Moose::Role</code> now can take an additional <code>-meta_name</code> option, which tells Moose what name to use when installing the <code>meta</code> method. Passing <code>undef</code> to this option suppresses generation of the <code>meta</code> method entirely. This should be useful for users of modules which also use a <code>meta</code> method or function, such as <a>Curses</a> or <a>Rose::DB::Object</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, deprecation mostly consisted of simply saying &quot;X is deprecated&quot; in the Changes file. We were not very consistent about actually warning. Now, all deprecated features still present in Moose actually give a warning. The warning is issued once per calling package.

<p><a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/Moose/Meta/Attribute.html">Moose::Meta::Attribute</a> now allows all options to be changed in an overridden attribute. The previous behaviour required each option to be whitelisted using the <code>legal_options_for_inheritance</code> method. This method has been removed, and there is a new method, <code>illegal_options_for_inheritance</code>, which can now be used to prevent certain options from being changeable.</p>

<p>In addition, we only throw an error if the illegal option is actually changed. If the superclass didn&#39;t specify this option at all when defining the attribute, the subclass version can still add it as an option.</p>

<p>Example of overriding this in an attribute trait:</p>

<pre><code>  package Bar::Meta::Attribute;
  use Moose::Role;

  has &#39;my_illegal_option&#39; =&gt; (
      isa =&gt; &#39;CodeRef&#39;,

<p>If you have a <code>no Moose</code> in your code <i>before</i> you call <code>blessed</code> or <code>confess</code>, your code will break. You can either move the <code>no Moose</code> call later in your code, or explicitly import the relevant functions from the packages that provide them.</p>

Metaclasses (classes that inherit from <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/Class/MOP/Object.html">Class::MOP::Object</a>) are currently exempt from this check, since at the moment we aren&#39;t very consistent about which metaclasses we immutabilize.</p>

<p>Previously, calling these functions with a list would take the first element of the list as the type constraint name, and use the remainder as the enum values or method names. This makes the interface inconsistent with the anon-type forms of these functions (which must take an arrayref), and a free-form list where the first value is sometimes special is hard to validate (and harder to give reasonable error messages for). These functions have been changed to take arrayrefs in all their forms - so, <code>enum &#39;My::Type&#39; =&gt; [qw(foo bar)]</code> is now the preferred way to create an enum type constraint.

<p>The internals of making a class immutable changed a lot in Class::MOP 0.78_02, and Moose&#39;s internals have changed along with it. The external <code>$metaclass-&gt;make_immutable</code> method still works the same way.</p>

<h1 id="pod0.72">0.72</h1>

<p>A mutable class accepted <code>Foo-&gt;new(undef)</code> without complaint, while an immutable class would blow up with an unhelpful error. Now, in both cases we throw a helpful error instead.</p>

<p>This &quot;feature&quot; was originally added to allow for cases such as this:</p>

<pre><code>  my $args;

  if ( something() ) {
      $args = {...};
  }

  return My::Class-&gt;new($args);</code></pre>

<p>But we decided this is a bad idea and a little too magical, because it can easily mask real errors.</p>

<h1 id="pod0.71_01">0.71_01</h1>

<p>Calling <code>type</code> or <code>subtype</code> without the sugar helpers (<code>as</code>, <code>where</code>, <code>message</code>) is now deprecated.</p>

<p>As a side effect, this meant we ended up using Perl prototypes on <code>as</code>, and code like this will no longer work:</p>

<pre><code>  use Moose::Util::TypeConstraints;
  use Declare::Constraints::Simple -All;

  subtype &#39;ArrayOfInts&#39;
      =&gt; as &#39;ArrayRef&#39;
      =&gt; IsArrayRef(IsInt);</code></pre>

<p>Instead it must be changed to this:</p>

<pre><code>  subtype(
      &#39;ArrayOfInts&#39; =&gt; {
          as    =&gt; &#39;ArrayRef&#39;,
          where =&gt; IsArrayRef(IsInt)
      }
  );</code></pre>

<p>If you want to maintain backwards compat with older versions of Moose, you must explicitly test Moose&#39;s <code>VERSION</code>:</p>

<pre><code>  if ( Moose-&gt;VERSION &lt; 0.71_01 ) {
      subtype &#39;ArrayOfInts&#39;
          =&gt; as &#39;ArrayRef&#39;
          =&gt; IsArrayRef(IsInt);
  }
  else {
      subtype(
          &#39;ArrayOfInts&#39; =&gt; {
              as    =&gt; &#39;ArrayRef&#39;,
              where =&gt; IsArrayRef(IsInt)
          }
      );
  }</code></pre>

<h1 id="pod0.70">0.70</h1>

<p>We no longer pass the meta-attribute object as a final argument to triggers. This actually changed for inlined code a while back, but the non-inlined version and the docs were still out of date.</p>

<p>If by some chance you actually used this feature, the workaround is simple. You fetch the attribute object from out of the <code>$self</code> that is passed as the first argument to trigger, like so:</p>

<pre><code>  has &#39;foo&#39; =&gt; (
      is      =&gt; &#39;ro&#39;,
      isa     =&gt; &#39;Any&#39;,
      trigger =&gt; sub {
          my ( $self, $value ) = @_;
          my $attr = $self-&gt;meta-&gt;find_attribute_by_name(&#39;foo&#39;);

          # ...
      }
  );</code></pre>

<h1 id="pod0.66">0.66</h1>

<p>If you created a subtype and passed a parent that Moose didn&#39;t know about, it simply ignored the parent. Now it automatically creates the parent as a class type. This may not be what you want, but is less broken than before.</p>

<p>You could declare a name with subtype such as &quot;Foo!Bar&quot;. Moose would accept this allowed, but if you used it in a parameterized type such as &quot;ArrayRef[Foo!Bar]&quot; it wouldn&#39;t work. We now do some vetting on names created via the sugar functions, so that they can only contain alphanumerics, &quot;:&quot;, and &quot;.&quot;.</p>

<h1 id="pod0.65">0.65</h1>

<p>Methods created via an attribute can now fulfill a <code>requires</code> declaration for a role. Honestly we don&#39;t know why Stevan didn&#39;t make this work originally, he was just insane or something.</p>

<p>Stack traces from inlined code will now report the line and file as being in your class, as opposed to in Moose guts.</p>

<h1 id="pod0.62_02">0.62_02</h1>

<p>When a class does not provide all of a role&#39;s required methods, the error thrown now mentions all of the missing methods, as opposed to just the first missing method.</p>

<p>Moose will no longer inline a constructor for your class unless it inherits its constructor from Moose::Object, and will warn when it doesn&#39;t inline. If you want to force inlining anyway, pass <code>replace_constructor =&gt; 1</code> to <code>make_immutable</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to get rid of the warning, pass <code>inline_constructor =&gt; 0</code>.</p>

<h1 id="pod0.62">0.62</h1>

<p>Removed the (deprecated) <code>make_immutable</code> keyword.</p>

<p>Removing an attribute from a class now also removes delegation (<code>handles</code>) methods installed for that attribute. This is correct behavior, but if you were wrongly relying on it you might get bit.</p>

<h1 id="pod0.58">0.58</h1>

<p>Roles now add methods by calling <code>add_method</code>, not <code>alias_method</code>. They make sure to always provide a method object, which will be cloned internally. This means that it is now possible to track the source of a method provided by a role, and even follow its history through intermediate roles. This means that methods added by a role now show up when looking at a class&#39;s method list/map.</p>

<p>Parameter and Union args are now sorted, this makes Int|Str the same constraint as Str|Int. Also, incoming type constraint strings are normalized to remove all whitespace differences. This is mostly for internals and should not affect outside code.</p>

<p><a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/Moose/Exporter.html">Moose::Exporter</a> will no longer remove a subroutine that the exporting package re-exports. Moose re-exports the Carp::confess function, among others. The reasoning is that we cannot know whether you have also explicitly imported those functions for your own use, so we err on the safe side and always keep them.</p>

<h1 id="pod0.56">0.56</h1>

<p><code>Moose::init_meta</code> should now be called as a method.</p>

<p>New modules for extension writers, <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/Moose/Exporter.html">Moose::Exporter</a> and <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/Moose/Util/MetaRole.html">Moose::Util::MetaRole</a>.</p>

<h1 id="pod0.55_01">0.55_01</h1>

<p>Implemented metaclass traits (and wrote a recipe for it):</p>

<pre><code>  use Moose -traits =&gt; &#39;Foo&#39;</code></pre>

<p>This should make writing small Moose extensions a little easier.</p>

<h1 id="pod0.55">0.55</h1>

<p>Fixed <code>coerce</code> to accept anon types just like <code>subtype</code> can. So that you can do:</p>

<pre><code>  coerce $some_anon_type =&gt; from &#39;Str&#39; =&gt; via { ... };</code></pre>

<h1 id="pod0.51">0.51</h1>

<p>Added <code>BUILDARGS</code>, a new step in <code>Moose::Object-&gt;new()</code>.</p>

<h1 id="pod0.49">0.49</h1>

<p>Fixed how the <code>is =&gt; (ro|rw)</code> works with custom defined <code>reader</code>, <code>writer</code> and <code>accessor</code> options. See the below table for details:</p>

<pre><code>  is =&gt; ro, writer =&gt; _foo    # turns into (reader =&gt; foo, writer =&gt; _foo)
  is =&gt; rw, writer =&gt; _foo    # turns into (reader =&gt; foo, writer =&gt; _foo)
  is =&gt; rw, accessor =&gt; _foo  # turns into (accessor =&gt; _foo)
  is =&gt; ro, accessor =&gt; _foo  # error, accesor is rw</code></pre>

<h1 id="pod0.45">0.45</h1>

<p>The <code>before/around/after</code> method modifiers now support regexp matching of method names. NOTE: this only works for classes, it is currently not supported in roles, but, ... patches welcome.</p>

<p>The <code>has</code> keyword for roles now accepts the same array ref form that <a href="../../../../lib/perl5/5.26.3/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/Moose.html">Moose</a>.pm does for classes.</p>

<p>A trigger on a read-only attribute is no longer an error, as it&#39;s useful to trigger off of the constructor.</p>

<p>Subtypes of parameterizable types now are parameterizable types themselves.</p>

<h1 id="pod0.44">0.44</h1>

<p>Fixed issue where <code>DEMOLISHALL</code> was eating the value in <code>$@</code>, and so not working correctly. It still kind of eats them, but so does vanilla perl.</p>

<h1 id="pod0.41">0.41</h1>

<p>Inherited attributes may now be extended without restriction on the type (&#39;isa&#39;, &#39;does&#39;).</p>

<p>The entire set of Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::* classes were refactored in this release. If you were relying on their internals you should test your code carefully.</p>

<h1 id="pod0.40">0.40</h1>

<p>Documenting the use of &#39;+name&#39; with attributes that come from recently composed roles. It makes sense, people are using it, and so why not just officially support it.</p>

<p>The <code>Moose::Meta::Class-&gt;create</code> method now supports roles.</p>

<p>It is now possible to make anonymous enum types by passing <code>enum</code> an array reference instead of the <code>enum $name =&gt; @values</code>.</p>

<h1 id="pod0.37">0.37</h1>

<p>Added the <code>make_immutable</code> keyword as a shortcut to calling <code>make_immutable</code> on the meta object. This eventually got removed!</p>

<p>Made <code>init_arg =&gt; undef</code> work in Moose. This means &quot;do not accept a constructor parameter for this attribute&quot;.</p>

<p>Type errors now use the provided message. Prior to this release they didn&#39;t.</p>

<h1 id="pod0.34">0.34</h1>

<p>Moose is now a postmodern object system :)</p>

<p>The Role system was completely refactored. It is 100% backwards compat, but the internals were totally changed. If you relied on the internals then you are advised to test carefully.</p>

<p>Added method exclusion and aliasing for Roles in this release.</p>

<p>Added the <a>Moose::Util::TypeConstraints::OptimizedConstraints</a> module.</p>

<p>Passing a list of values to an accessor (which is only expecting one value) used to be silently ignored, now it throws an error.</p>

<h1 id="pod0.26">0.26</h1>

<p>Added parameterized types and did a pretty heavy refactoring of the type constraint system.</p>

<p>Better framework extensibility and better support for &quot;making your own Moose&quot;.</p>

<h1 id="or-before">0.25 or before</h1>

<p>Honestly, you shouldn&#39;t be using versions of Moose that are this old, so many bug fixes and speed improvements have been made you would be crazy to not upgrade.</p>

<p>Also, I am tired of going through the Changelog so I am stopping here, if anyone would like to continue this please feel free.</p>
